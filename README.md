# Java-Game-Wave

/**
This is not originally made by me, it's just for the purpose of learning java, and how to work with GUI and create games.
*/

This repository contains the files required for creating the game Wave. It's basically a fun project. We are using java language for the coding purpose. 

As soon as the game completes, I'll write about how the files are linked to each other and in what order you should read the files.

First we are creating a package and then we are including all the files in it. We are writing scripts for each purpose.
